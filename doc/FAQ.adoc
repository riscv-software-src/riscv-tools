== What's Newlib?

https://www.sourceware.org/newlib/[Newlib] is a "C library intended for
use on embedded systems." It has the advantage of not having so much cruft
as Glibc at the obvious cost of incomplete support (and idiosyncratic
behavior) in the fringes. The porting process is much less complex than
that of Glibc because you only have to fill in a few stubs of glue code.

These stubs of code include the system calls that are supposed to
call into the operating system you're running on. Because there's
no operating system proper, the simulator runs (on top of it) a proxy
kernel (`riscv-pk`) to handle many system calls, like `open`, `close`,
and `printf`.
