Among other things, we have enabled by default: procfs, ext2, and the
HTIF virtualized devices (a block driver and console).

TIP: In development, it can be very useful to enable `Kernel hacking`
â†’ `Early printk`, which will print messages to the console if the
kernel crashes very early.

WARNING: To build the RISC-V kernel, you _must_ set the `ARCH` variable
to `riscv` in each invocation of `make`.
