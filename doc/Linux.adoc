= Linux

Among other things, we have enabled by default: procfs, ext2, and the
HTIF virtualized devices (a block driver and console).

TIP: In development, it can be very useful to enable `Kernel hacking`
â†’ `Early printk`, which will print messages to the console if the
kernel crashes very early.

WARNING: To build the RISC-V kernel, you _must_ set the `ARCH` variable
to `riscv` in each invocation of `make`.

Instead of building all of the tools in the `riscv-tools` set,
we only *need* to build `riscv-fesvr`, `riscv-isa-sim` and the
`riscv-gnu-toolchain` (configured for `riscv-linux`).

In addition, this will download https://www.busybox.net[BusyBox] to give
us a set of basic utilities once we've booted the Linux kernel.

You can do all of this with `make`:

TIP: If you want to speed up the process, you can pass the `-j[number]`
option to use `[number]` threads.

    $ make -j4 linux


The `linux` argument builds `riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc` (the
cross-compiler used to build binaries linked to `riscv-glibc`), a
`busybox` binary (`bbl`), and a compiled Linux kernel (`vmlinux`).
