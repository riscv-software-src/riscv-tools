riscv-tools [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/riscv/riscv-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/riscv/riscv-tools)
===========================================================================

This repository houses a set of RISC-V simulators, compilers, and other
tools, including the following projects:

* [Spike](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim/), the ISA simulator
* [riscv-tests](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-tests/), a battery of
ISA-level tests
* [riscv-opcodes](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-opcodes/), the
enumeration of all RISC-V opcodes executable by the simulator
* [riscv-pk](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-pk/), which contains `bbl`,
a boot loader for Linux and similar OS kernels, and `pk`, a proxy kernel that
services system calls for a target-machine application by forwarding them to
the host machine
* [riscv-fesvr](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-fesvr/), the host side of
a simulation tether that services system calls on behalf of a target machine

Several RISC-V tools that were previously maintained through this repository
have since been upstreamed to their parent projects.  Although this repository
continues to contain versions of the following tools, they are now primarily
supported and maintained via their parent projects:

* [Binutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/binutils/)
* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/), the GNU C Compiler
* [GDB](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/), the GNU Debugger
* [glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/), the GNU C Library
* [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/), an emulator
* [Newlib](https://sourceware.org/newlib/), a C library
* [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/)

Your favorite software distribution should already have packages for
these upstream tools, but if it doesn't then the [RISC-V Port of
OpenEmbedded](https://github.com/riscv/meta-riscv#quick-start) is a
great place to start!

	$ git submodule update --init --recursive
	$ export RISCV=/path/to/install/riscv/toolchain
	$ ./build.sh


Ubuntu packages needed:

	$ sudo apt-get install autoconf automake autotools-dev curl libmpc-dev libmpfr-dev libgmp-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev gawk build-essential bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib1g-dev device-tree-compiler pkg-config libexpat-dev

Fedora packages needed:

	$ sudo dnf install autoconf automake @development-tools curl dtc libmpc-devel mpfr-devel gmp-devel libusb-devel gawk gcc-c++ bison flex texinfo gperf libtool patchutils bc zlib-devel expat-devel

_Note:_ This requires a compiler with C++11 support (e.g. GCC >= 4.8).
To use a compiler different than the default, use:

	$ CC=gcc-5 CXX=g++-5 ./build.sh

_Note for OS X:_ We recommend using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the dependencies (`libusb dtc gawk gnu-sed gmp mpfr libmpc isl wget automake md5sha1sum`) or even to install the tools [directly](https://github.com/riscv/homebrew-riscv). This repo will build with Apple's command-line developer tools (clang) in addition to gcc.
